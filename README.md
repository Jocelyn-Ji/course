# Data Science for Software Engineering

See the [HEAT course syllabus](https://heat.csc.uvic.ca/coview/outline/2020/Fall/SENG/330) for all mark weights and course policies, textbooks, etc. The syllabus also contains the important information on course communication and schedules. 

Course content will be lectures and readings. Currently the plan is to convene in person. [Email me](mailto:nernst@uvic.ca) if you think you may miss lectures due to travel restrictions or other reasons.

<!--The first part of the course will be more lecture based, establishing some foundations in the topics taught and explored in this course.-->
<!--The second part of the course will be workshop based, with guest speakers and ample activities to drill into specific topics more deeply. The workshops will be on the following topics: code assessment techniques, knowledge sharing and collaboration, continuous software engineering, diversity and inclusion in software engineering, software engineering productivity, and ethics and reliability of empirical research in software engineering.-->

See [course requirements](requirements.md) for more details.

# Assessment

| Category                 | Value |
| ------------------------ | ----- |
| Project                  | 45%   |
| Assignments (4 * 7.5%)   | 30%   |
| Paper summary blog posts | 10%   |
| Participation            | 15%   |

Course participation: 15%
Assessed through participation in assigned group activity submissions, participation in class (e.g., asking questions and contributing to discussions), and commenting on student blog posts. 

Assignments: 30%
There are four assignments in the course, each assignment is worth 7.5% (for a total of 30% of your final grade). 

Projects: 55%
The project will be a substantial data science analysis of a software engineering problem of your choosing (with my guidance). The project will be completed in groups of 4 to 6 students (this may vary depending on course enrollment).

The grading breakdown is the same for undergraduate and graduate students, however, assignment/project expectations will differ.

Class attendance is required to pass the course (if you are sick, please let me know in advance of the lecture).

Course marks will be distributed via Connex.

## Instructors

* [Neil Ernst](http://neilernst.net), instructor. Please message me for office hours per HEAT (TBD) or request a Zoom meeting on Brightspace or email. 
* TBD

Please use Brightspace to message the TA first with programming questions and group issues. Direct personal issues to the instructor, nernst@uvic.ca

## Mechanics

The class will use [Github](https://github.com/SENG330) (course notes, project) and Brightspace (discussions, assignment posting, grades). Students will have to register their Github username (either a permanent one or a throwaway) with the instructors. Those with an objection to using Github please contact the instructor for workarounds. All Github activity is private to the class organization. Please see the privacy notice.

Grades and any interviews or videos are distributed via Brightspace for privacy compliance.

This course is a mostly held as a synchronous in-person-only offering.

<!--Students should expect that the course experience offered by this on-line course will be a variation of the on-campus courses. Learning outcomes will be altered and met using on-line methods.-->

Many course activities (such as group design activities, chat sessions) will expect synchronous participation (i.e. at the scheduled time).
Students should plan to attend all course components.
Courses will not be able to accommodate personal scheduling issues, including time zone variations (from Pacific Daylight time). Online sessions will be hosted using Zoom video conferencing sessions, some of which will be recorded.

To access Zoom you will be required to login through the UVic portal ([[https://uvic.zoom.us](https://uvic.zoom.us/)]) and you consequently will not be anonymous.

Participation in this course requires reliable and consistent access to on-line technology: a computer (desktop or laptop) and an Internet connection.
It will not be possible to adjust the course expectations, due dates, or learning outcomes for students who do not have the technological means to complete the course. Course expectations (learning outcomes, due dates, etc.) will assume on-line technology, without exception.

The university and the Faculty of Engineering has strong mandate to support Equity, Diversity and Inclusion: https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/about/equity/index.php
We as a teaching team will do what we can to create a positive, safe, and supportive environment for you to participate in all components of this course offering. I (the instructor) appreciate all feedback from you and ask that you feel free to message me to voice concerns or to arrange a time to discuss virtually in-person.

You are expected to be respectful of other students and the instructor/TAs: mute your microphone if you are not talking, participate by providing input, and asking questions using inclusive language and behavior.

Strict monitoring of academic integrity will be performed in this course for any work submitted for marks. See course component descriptions and Course Policies and Guidelines below for details on academic integrity expectations. Substantiated academic integrity violations will be referred to the Department's Academic Integrity Committee which will determine penalty and ensure a record of the violation is kept with the university.
